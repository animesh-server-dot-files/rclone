    config: fix in memory config not saving on the fly backend config
    
    Before this fix, saving a :backend config gave the error
    
        Can't save config "token" = "XXX" for on the fly backend ":backend"
    
    Even when using the in-memory config `--config ""`
    
    This fixes the problem by
    - always using the in memory config if it is configured
    - moving the check for a :backend config save to the file config backend
    
    It also removes the contents of the config items being saved from the
    log which saves confidential tokens being logged.
    
    Fixes #5451

    drive: fix some google docs being treated as files - fixes #5455
    
    At some point some google docs files started having sizes returned in
    their listing information.
    
    This then caused rclone to treat the docs as files which caused
    downloads to fail.
    
    The API docs now state that google docs may have sizes (whereas I'm
    pretty sure it didn't earlier).
    
    This fix removes the check for size, so google docs are identified
    solely by not having an MD5 checksum.

    atexit: Terminate with non-zero status after receiving signal
    
    When rclone received a SIGINT (Ctrl+C) or SIGTERM signal while an atexit
    function is registered it always terminated with status code 0. Unix
    convention is to exit with a non-zero status code. Often it's
    `128 + int(signum), but at least not zero.
    
    With this change fatal signals handled by the `atexit` package cause
    a non-zero exit code. On Unix systems it's `128 + int(signum)` while
    on other systems, such as Windows, it's always 2 ("error not otherwise
    categorised").
    
    Resolves #5437.

    Signal handling by the `atexit` package needs acceess to

    cmd: add hashSUM file support (#5352)
    
    Currently rclone check supports matching two file trees by sizes and hashes.
    This change adds support for SUM files produced by GNU utilities like sha1sum.
    
    Fixes #1005
    
    Note: checksum by default checks, hashsum by default prints sums.
    New flag is named "--checkfile" but carries hash name.
    Summary of introduced command forms:
    
    ```
    rclone check sums.sha1 remote:path --checkfile sha1
    rclone checksum sha1 sums.sha1 remote:path
    rclone hashsum sha1 remote:path --checkfile sums.sha1
    rclone sha1sum remote:path --checkfile sums.sha1
    rclone md5sum remote:path --checkfile sums.md5

    backend/local: skip entries removed concurrently with List() (#5297)
    
    This change fixes the bug described below:
    if a file is removed while the local backend List() runs,
    the call will flag an accounting error.
    The bug manifests itself if local backend is the Sync target
    due to intrinsic concurrency.
    The odds to hit this bug depend on --checkers and --transfers.
    Chunker over local backend is affected even more because
    updating a composite object with a smaller size content
    translates into removing chunks on the underlying file system
    and involves a number of List() calls.

    cmdtest: end-to-end test for commands, flags and environment variables
    
    There was no easy way to automatically test the end-to-end functionality
    of commands, flags, environment variables etc.
    
    The need for end-to-end testing was highlighted by the issues fixed
    in #5341. There was no automated test to continually verify current
    behaviour, nor a framework to quickly test the correctness of the fixes.
    
    This change adds an end-to-end testing framework in the cmdtest folder.
    It has some simple examples in func TestCmdTest in cmdtest_test.go. The
    tests should be readable by anybody familiar with rclone and look like
    this:
    
        // Test the rclone version command with debug logging (-vv)
        out, err = rclone("version", "-vv")
        if assert.NoError(t, err) {
            assert.Contains(t, out, "rclone v")
            assert.Contains(t, out, "os/version:")
            assert.Contains(t, out, " DEBUG : ")
        }
    
    The end-to-end tests are executed just like the Go unit tests, that is:
    
        go test ./cmdtest -v
    
    The change also contains a thorough test of environment variables in
    environment_test.go.
    
    Thanks to @ncw for encouragement and introduction to the TestMain trick.

    config: fixed issues with flags/options set by environment vars.
    
    Some environment variables didn’t behave like their corresponding
    command line flags. The affected flags were --stats, --log-level,
    --separator, --multi-tread-streams, --rc-addr, --rc-user and --rc-pass.
    Example:
    
        RCLONE_STATS='10s'
        rclone check remote: remote: --progress
        # Expected: rclone check remote: remote: --progress –-stats=10s
        # Actual: rclone check remote: remote: --progress
    
    Remote specific options set by environment variables was overruled by
    less specific backend options set by environment variables. Example:
    
        RCLONE_DRIVE_USE_TRASH='false'
        RCLONE_CONFIG_MYDRIVE_USE_TRASH='true'
        rclone deletefile myDrive:my-test-file
        # Expected: my-test-file is recoverable in the trash folder
        # Actual: my-test-file is permanently deleted (not recoverable)
    
    Backend specific options set by environment variables was overruled by
    general backend options set by environment variables. Example:
    
        RCLONE_SKIP_LINKS='true'
        RCLONE_LOCAL_SKIP_LINKS='false'
        rclone lsd local:
        # Expected result: Warnings when symlinks are skipped
        # Actual result: No warnings when symlinks are skipped
        # That is RCLONE_SKIP_LINKS takes precedence
    
    The above issues have been fixed.
    
    The debug logging (-vv) has been enhanced to show when flags are set by
    environment variables.
    
    The documentation has been enhanced with details on the precedence of
    configuration options.
    
    See pull request #5341 for more information.

    Nothing is added or removed and no package is renamed by this change.
    Just rearrange definitions between source files in the fs directory.
    
    New source files:
    - types.go      Filesystem types and interfaces
    - features.go   Features and optional interfaces
    - registry.go   Filesystem registry and backend options
    - newfs.go      NewFs and its helpers
    - configmap.go  Getters and Setters for ConfigMap
    - pacer.go      Pacer with logging and calculator
    The final fs.go contains what is left.
    
    Also rename options.go to open_options.go
    to dissociate from registry options.

    s3: don't check to see if remote is object if it ends with /
    
    Before this change, rclone would always check the root to see if it
    was an object.
    
    This change doesn't check to see if the root is an object if the path
    ends with a /
    
    This avoids a transaction where rclone HEADs the path to see if it
    exists.
    
    See #4990

    local: add --local-unicode-normalization (and remove --local-no-unicode-normalization)
    
    macOS stores files in NFD form and transferring them like this to some
    systems causes the Korean language to display incorrectly.
    
    This adds the flag --local-unicode-normalization to optionally
    normalize the file names to NFC.
    
    This also removes the (long deprecated) --local-no-unicode-normalization flag

    fs: change Config callback into state based callback #3455
    
    This is a very large change which turns the post Config function in
    backends into a state based call and response system so that
    alternative user interfaces can be added.
    
    The existing config logic has been converted, but it is quite
    complicated and folloup commits will likely be needed to fix it!
    
    Follow up commits will add a command line and API based way of using
    this configuration system.

    local: always use readlink to read symlink size
    
    It was discovered on some Android systems, the stat size of a symlink
    is different to the size that readlink returns.
    
    This was giving errors like this
    
        transport connection broken: http: ContentLength=30 with Body length 28
    
    There are enough exceptions to the size of readlink being different to
    the size of stat that this patch now always does readlink to work out
    the size of a symlink.
    
    Since symlinks are relatively uncommon this shouldn't affect
    performance too much and will mean that the size is always correct.
    
    This deprecates the --local-zero-size-links flag which is now
    effectively always enabled.
    
    See: https://forum.rclone.org/t/problem-with-symlinks-and-links/23840/

    gomobile interface.
    
    This also adds a gomobile interface RcloneMobileRPC which uses generic
    go types conforming to the gobind restrictions.
    
    It also fixes up initialisation errors.

    Before this change but after:
    
    aea8776a4368ee8a vfs: fix modtimes not updating when writing via cache #4763
    
    When a file was opened read-only the modtime was read from the cached
    file. However this modtime wasn't correct leading to an incorrect
    result.
    
    This change fixes the definition of `item.IsDirty` to be true only
    when the data is dirty. This fixes the problem as a read only file
    isn't considered dirty.

    backend/tardigrade: use negative offset
    
    v1.4.6 of uplink allows us to do a negative offset from the end of the
    file. This removes a round trip when requesting the last N bytes of a
    file.
    
    Previous to v1.4.6 of uplink it wasn't possible to do a negative offset
    on download. This meant that to fulfill the semantics of http range
    headers it was necessary to first fetch the size of the object via a
    stat call and compute absolute offset and length.

    config: delay load config file (#5258)
    
    Restructuring of config code in v1.55 resulted in config
    file being loaded early at process startup. If configuration
    file is encrypted this means user will need to supply the password,
    even when running commands that does not use config.
    This also lead to an issue where mount with --deamon failed to
    decrypt the config file when it had to prompt user for passord.

    vfs: Add cache reset for --vfs-cache-max-size handling at cache poll interval
    
    The vfs-cache-max-size parameter is probably confusing to many users.
    The cache cleaner checks cache size periodically at the --vfs-cache-poll-interval
    (default 60 seconds) interval and remove cache items in the following order.
    
    (1) cache items that are not in use and with age > vfs-cache-max-age
    (2) if the cache space used at this time still is larger than
    vfs-cache-max-size, the cleaner continues to remove cache items that are
    not in use.
    
    The cache cleaning process does not remove cache items that are currently in use.
    If the total space consumed by in-use cache items exceeds vfs-cache-max-size, the
    periodical cache cleaner thread does not do anything further and leaves the in-use
    cache items alone with a total space larger than vfs-cache-max-size.
    
    A cache reset feature was introduced in 1.53 which resets in-use (but not dirty,
    i.e., not being updated) cache items when additional cache data incurs an ENOSPC
    error.  But this code was not activated in the periodical cache cleaning thread.
    
    This patch adds the cache reset step in the cache cleaner thread during cache
    poll to reset cache items until the total size of the remaining cache items is
    below vfs-cache-max-size.

    b2: don't include the bucket name in public link file prefixes
    
    Including the bucket name as part of the `fileNamePrefix` passed to
    `b2_get_download_authorization` results in a link valid for objects that
    have the bucket name as part of the object path; e.g.,
    
        rclone link :b2:some-bucket/some-file
    
    would result in a public link valid for the object
    `some-bucket/some-file` in the `some-bucket` bucket (in rclone-remote
    parlance, `:b2:some-bucket/some-bucket/some-file`). This will almost
    certainly result in a broken link.
    
    The B2 docs don't explicitly specify this behavior, but the example
    given for `fileNamePrefix` provides some clarification.
    
    See https://www.backblaze.com/b2/docs/b2_get_download_authorization.html.

    s3: remove WebIdentityRoleProvider to fix crash on auth #5255
    
    This code removes the code added in
    
    15d19131bd6bc78e s3: use aws web identity role provider
    
    This code no longer works because it doesn't initialise the
    tokenFetcher - leading to a nil pointer crash.
    
    The proper way to initialise this is with the
    NewWebIdentityCredentials but it isn't clear where to get the other
    parameters: roleARN, roleSessionName, path.
    
    In the linked issue a user reports rclone working with EKS anyway, so
    perhaps this code is no longer needed.
    
    If it is needed, hopefully someone who knows AWS better will come
    along and fix it!

    sftp: Fix performance regression by re-enabling concurrent writes #5197
    
    Betweeen rclone v1.54 and v1.55 there was an approx 3x performance
    regression when transferring to distant SFTP servers (in particular
    rsync.net).
    
    This turned out to be due to the library github.com/pkg/sftp rclone
    uses. Concurrent writes used to be enabled in this library by default
    (for v1.12.0 as used in rclone v1.54) but they are no longer enabled
    (for v1.13.0 as used in rclone v1.55) for safety reasons and it is
    necessary to enable them specifically.
    
    The safety concerns are due to the uncertainty as to whether writes
    come in order and whether a half completed file might have holes in
    it. This isn't a problem for rclone since a) it doesn't restart
    uploads and b) it has a post-transfer checksum test.
    
    This change introduces a new flag `--sftp-disable-concurrent-writes`
    to control the feature which defaults to false, meaning that
    concurrent writes are enabled as in v1.54.
    
    However this isn't quite enough to fix the problem as the sftp library
    needs to be able to sniff the size of the stream from the reader
    passed in, so this also adds a `Size` interface to the reader to
    enable this. This involved a patch to the library.
    
    The library was reverted to v1.12.0 for v1.55.1 - this patch installs

    box: use upload preflight check to avoid listings in file uploads
    
    Before this change, rclone checked to see if an object existed before
    doing an upload by listing the destination directory. This was very
    inefficient, especially with large directories.
    
    After this change rclone uses the pre upload check API call which
    checks to see if it is OK to upload an object, and also returns the ID
    of an existing object which saves rclone having to do a directory
    listing.

    onedrive: Work around for random "Unable to initialize RPS" errors
    
    OneDrive randomly returns the error message: "InvalidAuthenticationToken: Unable to initialize RPS". These unexpected errors typically caused the entire rclone command to fail.
    
    This work around recognizes these errors and marks them for a low level retry, that mostly succeeds. This will make rclone commands complete without being noticeable affected.

    backend/ftp: fix implicit TLS after PR #4266 (#5219)
    
    PR #4266 modified ftpConnection to make ftp library into using
    a custom dial function which is QoS aware and takes care of TLS.
    However the ServerConn.Login function from the ftp library also needs
    TLS config passed explicitly as a trigger for sending PSBZ and PROT
    options to FTP server. This was not taken care of resulting in
    failure to connect via FTP with implicit TLS.
    This PR fixes that.

    rclone authorize: Send and receive extra config options to fix oauth
    
    Before this change any backends which required extra config in the
    oauth phase (like the `region` for zoho) didn't work with `rclone
    authorize`.
    
    This change serializes the extra config and passes it to `rclone
    authorize` and returns new config items to be set from rclone
    authorize.
    
    `rclone authorize` will still accept its previous configuration
    parameters for use with old rclones.

    sftp: fix Update ReadFrom failed: failed to send packet: EOF errors
    
    In
    
    a3fcadddc871e646 sftp: close idle connections after --sftp-idle-timeout (1m by default)
    
    Idle SFTP connections were closed after 1 minute. However due to the
    way SSH multiplexes connections over a single SSH connection this
    meant that if uploads or downloads went on for more than one minute
    they failed with "EOF errors" as their underlying connection was
    closed.
    
    This fixes the problem by not clearing idle connections if there are
    any transfers in progress.
    
    Fixes #5197

    selfupdate: dont detect FUSE if build is static
    
    Before this patch selfupdate detected ANY build with cmount tag as a build
    having libFUSE capabilities. However, only dynamic builds really have it.
    The official linux builds are static and have the cmount tag as of the time
    of this writing. This results in inability to update official linux binaries.
    This patch fixes that. The build can be fixed independently.

    drive: switch to the Drives API for looking up shared drives - fixes #3139
    
    Before this change rclone used the deprecated teamdrives API. This
    change uses the new drives API (which seems to be the teamdrives API
    renames).
